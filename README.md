# Typescript Projects

This repository contains a collection of small **TypeScript pet projects** that I built while practicing and learning TypeScript.  
Each project is located in its own folder, and can be run independently.

## üìå Projects

### 1. Google Maps App
A simple application that integrates **Google Maps**.  
It displays a randomly generated **User** and **Company** on the world map using the [`faker`](https://github.com/faker-js/faker) library.  

Main classes:
- `User`  
- `Company`  
- `CustomMap`

**Example code:**
```ts
/// <reference types="@types/google.maps" />
import { CustomMap } from "./CustomMap";
import { User } from "./User";
import { Company } from "./Company";

const map = new CustomMap('map');
const user = new User();
const company = new Company();

map.addMarker(user);
map.addMarker(company);
```

**How to run:**
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd google-maps-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the project (depending on your setup, for example with parcel or webpack):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open the browser to see the map with the user and company markers.

### 2. Sort
This project demonstrates how to build a flexible **sorting algorithm** that works with different data types:  
- Strings (`CharactersCollection`)  
- Numbers (`NumberCollection`)  
- Linked Lists (`LinkedList`)  

The idea is to have a reusable `Sorter` class that can sort any collection which implements a common interface.

**Example code:**
```ts
import { Sorter } from "./Sorter";
import { NumberCollection } from "./NumberCollection";
import { CharactersCollection } from "./CharactersCollection";
import { LinkedList } from "./LinkedList";

const numbers = new NumberCollection([-3, -5, 10, 223, -232, 25, 999, 76, 32]);
numbers.sort();

const characters = new CharactersCollection('pqxzyrwteafdsa');
characters.sort();

const linkedList = new LinkedList();
linkedList.add(10);
linkedList.add(3);
linkedList.add(322);
linkedList.add(2112);
linkedList.sort();

console.log(numbers.data);
console.log(characters.data);
linkedList.print();
```

**How to run:**
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sort
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   tsc
   ```
4. Run the compiled code with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node build/index.js
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed  
- TypeScript installed globally or locally (`npm install -g typescript`)  

---

## üöÄ Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate into any project folder you want to try:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typescript-projects.git
cd typescript-projects
```

Then follow the instructions in each project section above.

## üìñ Notes
These projects are made **for learning purposes** only.  
They cover TypeScript fundamentals such as:
- Classes and interfaces
- Generics
- Working with external libraries
- Basic data structures and algorithms
- Interacting with APIs (Google Maps)
